# Dark Age of Valheim

###### How can it get any darker? 


## Version 1.0 Changes


Expand functionality of EpicMMO to allow skill ups to grant xp of skill gain * 10

Extract out mob kill functionality so that every mob grants xp, not just mobs stored in json file.

Add command that allows user to add XP to a user instead of hard setting a level.

Add EpicMMO Stats (Parameters in code) as effects that can generate on drops. 

EpicMMO Level up now fires an Action that can be subscribed to.


#####WIP
Implemented basic localization
More sophisticated stat assignment on EpicLoot drops
Class based system (Bonus to skills/abilities)
Skill Tree?
